# Jack Doyle - Bioinformatics & Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Jack! I've completed a Masters of Science in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at University College Cork (UCC). I am passionate about performing data analysis and machine learning to discover meaningful insights in biological systems. My technical background spans across bioinformatics, computational biology, and environmental data analysis, and I am excited to apply these skills to complex, real-world challenges.

During my masters studies, I developed expertise in Python, R, and SQL, with hands-on experience in tools like BLAST, Bioconductor, and genomic databases. My thesis project focused on developing a machine learning framework tailored to microbiome research, which allows for robust and accurate analysis of biological datasets.

Before UCC, I earned a First Class Honours degree in Biological and Biomedical Sciences from Trinity College Dublin, where I developed a detailed understanding of molecular biology, ecosystems and their complex interactions. Additionally, I developed a basic understanding of data analysis and statistical computation. These skills came together in my thesis, where I conducted a systematic review on legume intercropping trends for sustainable agriculture.

Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies and working on personal projects that merge data science with biology. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I thrive on solving complex problems and discovering new patterns in data.

### UCC Master Thesis: Microbiome Machine Learning Pipeline
This project outlines the development of a machine learning pipeline for classification, multiclassification, and regression of microbiome data. Key functions include:

- `run_ml_cv`: Cross-validation pipeline that handles data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.
- `run_ml_nestedcv`: Nested cross-validation pipeline for more rigorous model evaluation.

The pipeline is designed to work with datasets such as OTU tables from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and accompanying metadata. Feature selection is performed using methods like `glm_filter` and `boruta_filter`, and models are evaluated using metrics such as ROC curves and feature importance.

**Skills**: Machine learning, Data preprocessing, Cross-validation, Feature selection, Hyperparameter tuning.

**Technology**: R, caret, dplyr, and ggplot2.

For more details on how these functions were implemented and the rationale behind the feature selection methods, check the code and accompanying thesis document in the repository.
